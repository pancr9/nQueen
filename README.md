Solving N-queens

![Solving N-queens](https://github.com/pancr9/nQueen/blob/master/nQueen.png)


>The N-queens problem is ideally suited to constraint programming. This is a short C++ program that solves N-queens for any value of N.

It uses two approaches along with A * algorithm.
1. Minimum Conflicts
2. Hii Climbing

Our constraints will be:

* No two queens should be on same row or column.
* Each row and column should contain only one queen.
